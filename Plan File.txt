This is a basic weather app. The reason for that is the limitation of the 
OpenWeather API that is going to be utilised. As I'm going to be using a free
plan I won't bother with security the API key as it is publicly available. 

Outline:
1. Make the API work
2. Process the data and output it
3. Add a basic form to allow use to search a location and then output data
  below
4. Come up with a design
5. Make the website
6. Add more features as need be


Development:
1. This is quite simple. Goal is to get data from the API and output it to 
  console. Nothing fancy, just a simple promise
