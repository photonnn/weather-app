# weather-app

This is a basic weather app. The reason for that is the limitation of the 
OpenWeatherMap API that is utilised. As I used a free plan I did not bother with
hiding the API key. 

The premise of the app is to display weather for any city in the world. The time
displayed on the forecast is your local time for all of the cities. The timezone
is provided to help with calulating the local time there. Though I'd imagine 
a future version of this app might contain functionality to switch between your
local time and their local time just like how the units can be changed.

Was built in pure javascript as I do not yet have the knowledge of any of the 
frameworks.

I have included a plan file which is to be utilised as a documentation of the 
frame of mind/perspective that I've had while working on the project. 
The design is my typical, a more user friendly app would include pictures of the
weather and perhaps shortened and more user friendly weather forecast. The API
also has some useful weather maps which could be included. 

All in all, I did not go all the way with this project, This is likely my last 
pure javascript project whose purpose is pure javascript alone. There are still
more projects to be done in pure javascript, but they have an additional
component to be learned (ex. testing).
