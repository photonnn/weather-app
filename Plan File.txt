This is a basic weather app. The reason for that is the limitation of the 
OpenWeatherMap API that is going to be utilised. As I'm going to be using a free
plan I won't bother with security the API key as it is publicly available. 

Outline:
1. Make the API work
2. Process the data and output it
3. Add a basic form to allow use to search a location and then output data
  below
4. Come up with a design
5. Make the website
6. Add more features as need be


Development:
1. This is quite simple. Goal is to get data from the API and output it to 
  console. Nothing fancy, just simple chain of promises.

2. Here comes the part when I have to decide what data is useful.

  Checklist:
  - Wind: km/h
  - Weather: main (clouds) + description (ex. "scattered clouds")
  - Temperature in Kelvin
  - Humidity in %
  - 'Feels like' in Kelvin
  - Pressure in mb
  - Timezone, 3600 = GMT+1
              -18000 = GMT-5

I roughly imagine design, which is mobile-first. At the top there is city name,
below time and temperature. other information is below in table like format, 
that is property (wind) on the left and value (4.2km/h) on the right.

3. I've made a seperate module and made a table for all the information that 
  we are outputting. It works perfectly well now. Input city and get weather.
  However, ... .... .... ..., I realised that OpeanWeatherAPI isn't that useless
  I can actually get the forecast data O,O. I though basic weather info was all
  that I could get o,O. Turns out I have to go back to step 2. I have to rethink
  of a way to make mobile design fit the forecast as well. Even more there are
  actually weather maps that you can use.
